# -A-RESUME-PORTFOLIO

 
ðŸ›  Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome, Google Fonts

I developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background in a structured and visually appealing format. This project serves as a digital resume and portfolio, making it easier for potential employers, collaborators, and clients to understand my capabilities and access my work online.

The website is organized into several main sections:

Home: A clean and engaging landing page with a short personal introduction.

About: Contains a detailed overview of my background, career objectives, and education.

Skills: Displays my technical and soft skills using progress bars and icons to enhance readability.

Projects: Highlights selected projects with descriptions, live links, and GitHub repositories.

Contact: A working contact form for visitors to reach out directly.

I used Bootstrap 5 to ensure full responsiveness across all devices and screen sizes. The layout adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile using the Bootstrap grid system and utility classes. I also customized Bootstrap components with CSS to give the website a unique and personal style.

For design, I focused on maintaining a professional and modern aesthetic, using a minimal color scheme and clean typography from Google Fonts. Font Awesome icons were used to improve navigation and visual hierarchy.

This project reflects my front-end development skills and understanding of modern web design practices, including responsive layout, semantic HTML, and custom CSS styling. It also demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a user-friendly interface that communicates effectively.
